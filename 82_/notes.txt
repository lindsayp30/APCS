HW82 -- Roll Your Own Iterator
2022-03-28m
time spent: 0.5 hr

DISCO
- We can create a class inside another class!
- We created 'call' to fix the incompatible error as the method returns type T
  and, since we utilized the methods in DLLNode, there is DLLNode<T>

QCC
- In the remove method, the guidelines tell us to return something when the method is void.
  Why is this?
- When would we choose to implement an Iterator?
