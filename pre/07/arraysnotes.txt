--> array: sequence of values
--> elements: values in the array
values in array must have the same type

CREATING ARRAYS
--> declare a variable with an array type
--> create the array itself
--> array types are followed by square brackets
--> must use the <new> operator
--> integer expression for the size of an array can not be negative values as one would get a <NegativeArraySizeException>
--> arrays with zero elements are fine

DISPLAYING ARRAYS
--> one can use println, but the elemnts of the array are not displayed

COPYING ARRAYS
--> if one wants to copy the array and not just a reference, one has to create a new array and copy the elements from the old array to the new array
--> another option is <java.util.Arrays> with method copy0f
double[] b = Arrays.copy0f(#,#)
#,# is the number of elements one wants to copy, enabling one to copy just part of an array

ARRAY LENGTH
--> a.length
double[] b = Arrays.copy0f(#,a.length)

ARRAY TRAVERSAL
--> array traversal: looking through the elements of an array
--> search: common pattern involving traversing an array for a particular element
--> reduce: common traversal operation that takes an array of values and makes it a single value
done through sum of elements, product of elements, minimum of elements, maximum of elements...
--> accumulator: a variable used to collect the sum of the elements at the end of the loop
