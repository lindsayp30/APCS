--> void method: method that does not return a value

RETURN VALUES
--> when compared to void methods, value methods differ in that 
they declare the type of the return value 
they use at least one return statement ot provide a return value

WRITING METHODS
--> key aspects in incremental development
1. start with a working program and make small changes
at any point, if there is an error, one would know where to look 
2. use variables to hold intermediate values so one can check them either with print statements or by using a debugger [detects and corrects errors]
3. once the program is working, one can consolidate multiple statements into compound expressions 

METHOD COMPOSITION
--> functional decomposition: process for breaking down a complex computation into simpler methods and then composing the methods to perform the computation

OVERLOADING
--> defining more than one method with the same name but different parameters
rename

JAVACDOC TAGS
--> documentation comments can be made using /**
--> to organize documentation into sections, optional tags that begin with @ are used

--> Turing complete: programming language that is said to implement any possible algorithm

--> leap of faith: a way to read recursive programs such that instead of following the flow of execution, one assumes that the method works and returns the appropriate value
work through it?
