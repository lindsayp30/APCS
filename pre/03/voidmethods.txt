--> argument: value provided when one invokes a method 
--> invoke: cause a method to execute
--> parameters: list of variables in the parentheses after the method that is needed before running
argument and parameter must have the same type
--> local variable: variable declared inside a method
can not be accessed from outside of the method
--> signature: first line of a method that defines name, return type, and parameters

BENEFITS OF CREATING A NEW METHOD...
--> gives one the opportunity to give a name to a group of statements
makes code easier to read and understand.
--> can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code
--> since common problem solving technique is to break tasks down into sub-problems, more methods allow one to focus on each sub-problem in isolation, and then compose them into a complete solution
