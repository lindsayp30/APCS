--> iteration: executing the same code multiple times

THE WHILE STATEMENT
--> expression in paretheses is the condition
--> statements in braces are the body
--> flow of statement
1. evaluate the condition
yield of true or false
2. if the condition is false, skip the body and proceed to the next statement
3. f the condition is true, execute the body and go back to step 1
--> in order to termnate the loop, the value of one or more variables should change such that the condition eventually becomes false and terminates

ENCAPSULATION AND GENERALIZATION
1. write a few lines of code in main or another method, and test them
2. after confirming that they work, wrap them in a new method, and test again
encapsulation - wrapping a sequence of statements in a method
3. if appropriate, replace literal values with variables and parameters
generalization - replacing something that is unnecessarily specific with something general

THE FOR STATEMENT
--> (initializer; the condition; the update)
initializer runs once at the beginning of the loop
condition is checked each time through the loop, continuing on until false
update does what is told
	(int i = 1; i <= rows; i = i + 1)

BREAK AND CONTINUE
--> break statement exits current loop
--> continue statement moves on to the next iteration
