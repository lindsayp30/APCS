HW85 -- Leon Leonwood Stack / stack but with ArrayList and Linked List
2022-03-31r
time spent: 0.5 hr

DISCO
- We have to make an object of type PANCAKE when popping. We can't simply return _stack.
- We don't need stackSize due to the inherited methods in ArrayList and LinkedList.
- ArrayList and LinkedList can not have a general type. That is why <Z> doesn't work.

QCC
- We made sure to append ALStack, LLStack, ArrayList, and LinkedList with <PANCAKE>.
