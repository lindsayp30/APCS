HW90 -- Swabbing the Deque / double ended queue
2022-04-13w
time spent: 1.0 hrs

DISCO
* getFirst() and getLast() are similar in functionality to peekFirst() and peekLast()
  with the difference of the latter returning null if empty.
* There is no isEmpty() method in the API.
* Interface Deque implements class LinkedList. Thus, we can pass through the already
  written methods.

QCC
* Wouldn't it be more efficient to just have peekFirst() and peekLast() methods in
  the API than to include getFirst() and getLast()?
* How can we create a toString for a deque?
