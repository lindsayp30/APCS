HW91 -- Deque the Halls / double ended queue

time spent: 0.5 hrs

DISCO
* getFirst() and getLast() are similar in functionality to peekFirst() and peekLast()
  with the difference of the latter returning null if empty.
* There is no isEmpty() method in the API.
* Interface Deque implements class LinkedList. Thus, we can pass through the already
  written methods.
* We improved the content of our Deque file by adding comments to explain each method.
* In order to implement iterator() and addAll(Collection c), we need to import Iterator
  and Collection.
* Similar to how int has Object Integer, the char version of this is Character.

QCC
* Wouldn't it be more efficient to just have peekFirst() and peekLast() methods in
  the API than to include getFirst() and getLast()?
* How can we create a toString for a deque?
* What does it mean for an iterator to have its elements in proper sequence?
