# PLAN OF ACTION

1. removeFirst()
2. addFirst(CARD c)
3. peekFirst()
4. removeLast()
5. addLast(CARD c)
6. peekLast()
7. isEmpty()
8. size()
9. contains(Object c)
10. iterator()
11. addAll(Collection<CARD> c)
12. descendingIterator()
13. removeFirstOccurrence(Object c)
14. removeLastOccurrence(Object c)

Since we already implemented enqueue(CARD c), dequeue(), and peek() in the last homework, we started with removeFirst(), addFirst(CARD c), and peekFirst(), which are essentially the same methods. Afterward, we implemented removeLast(), addLast(CARD c), and peekLast(). We decided to include isEmpty() and size() because we did something similar in a previous homework. Finally, we looked through the API and included some methods that were not deemed necessary but interesting to include.
