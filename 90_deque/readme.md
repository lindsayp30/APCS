HW90 -- Swabbing the Deque / double ended queue

2022-04-13w

time spent: 1.0 hrs

# PLAN OF ACTION

1. removeFirst()
2. addFirst(CARD c)
3. peekFirst()
4. removeLast()
5. addLast(CARD c)
6. peekLast()
7. isEmpty()
8. size()

Since we already implemented enqueue(CARD c), dequeue(), and peek() in the last homework, we started with removeFirst(), addFirst(CARD c), and peekFirst(), which are essentially the same methods. Afterward, we implemented removeLast(), addLast(CARD c), and peekLast(). Finally, we ended with isEmpty() and size() because we did something similar in a previous homework.
