DISCO
* The constructor should initialize the root node.
* We have three components for each traversal (recursing left, printing the cargo,
  recursing right). What differs is the order in which they're called.
* It would be more fitting to have System.out.print than System.out.println since
  we would prefer the nodes stated on a single line.
* Compare the cargo when inserting to decide if there is a leftward or rightward
  traversal.

QCC
* We noticed that there is no stated protection type for methods in the TreeNode
  file. We assume that the default is public.
* Thanks for the informative comments on top of each method! Very helpful.
* Trace, trace, trace!
* We are constantly getting NullPointerExceptions when running BST.java, which
  complied, and we are not sure why.

HOW WE CAN DO BETTER
* In our code, we forgot to set the currNode to the left or right.
* Insertion affects how balanced a tree is.
* Best optimal insertion order allows for the lowest height.
* Worst "      "         is in-order and in descending order.
* Communication that matters: parents to children. Child does not need to know its
  parent.
* Helper -- cleaner signature.

With L = level, d = depth, h = heightâ€¦

    a perfect binary tree has __an even number of__ nodes (in each level but first)
    at each level, a perfect binary tree has __2^L-1__ nodes
    height of a complete binary tree w/ n nodes is __d__
