start Decided to try the mcRib as I never had it. Left work around 4pm and order through the app. It was pretty busy but service was efficient/organized. I didn't wait too long for my food and it came hot. I regretted not ordering fries as I saw the lady pulled out fresh fries from the fryer. I ordered the mcRib without pickles and asked for extra napkins as a precaution as I'm expecting it to be saucy & messy. It is takeout only so I ate outside the shop. I used a napkin to wrap around the sandwich to eat which help with the messiness. The sandwich was tender, juicy and succulent. Now I understand why people rave about it and I wouldn't mind eating it once in awhile.
