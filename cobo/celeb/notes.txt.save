DISCO
- Work with the mechanics of the terminal before implementing GUI (Graphical User
  Interface).
- While the GUI is not necessary, it is a nice visualizer.
- (ACTIVITY 2) We made more than one constructor in the Celebrity class as we wanted
  to be able to test the set methods.
- Swing 

QCC
- What is the difference between using a class and using an instance variable?
- (add on to this) Logic vs. functionality ?
