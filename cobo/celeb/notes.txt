DISCO
- Work with the mechanics of the terminal before implementing GUI (Graphical User
  Interface).
- While the GUI is not necessary, it is a nice visualizer.
- (ACTIVITY 2) We made more than one constructor in the Celebrity class as we wanted
  to be able to test the set methods.
- (javax.swing.) The swing that is being referenced is a set of librarie. There is a relationship
  between the program and the widgets within a machine. This would come in handy with GUIs (visual
  representations).
- Reminder: read carefully to not miss any details.
- The GUI doesn't pop up due to empty methods found. This is due to the untouched CelebrityFrame.

QCC
- What is the difference between using a class and using an instance variable?
- There are so many instance variables... how do we keep track of them?
- The setup methods in CelebrityFrame and StartPanel are empty. There are no instructions on how
  to complete them. What should we do?
