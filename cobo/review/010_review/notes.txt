QCC

- how was this data on how positive/negative a word is obtained?
- should we a have a required format or are we making entirely new sentences in the upcoming lab

1)
	A) sentimentVal( String word )
	B) yes, it requires a string.
	c) return type double.
3)
	A) yes, correct initialization and arguments
	B) No the initialization is a string and the argument a double, they are switched
	C) No, while the initialization is correct, the number of arguments is not.
4.2)
	A) totalSentiment essentially iterates through the review per each string word and checks the sentiment value
	  of each adding to each other as it goes.
5.2)
	A) Yes kind of, they tend to be deflated as some regular words are deemed bad and some, in context, great words are deemed ok
	B) could have it acccount for double negatives or account for the proportions of the review
6.2)
	A) he has essentially made it very unlikely to not get a 4 or 0, as their if statements have made the highewst star
	inclusive rather than exclusive, he has made everything LOWER than 15 be given a 4 at the top of his if chain. simply
	change them to be upper exclsuive and this should fix it
3.3)
	A)indexOf provides the index or posiiton for any action and substring allows fro the sectioning off of a string. adding 1
	is important becasue teh indexOf method is inclusive on the 'first' index
5.3)
	A) Static decides how it can be called, static means both the class and object can call it, whereas non-static belongs exclusivley
	to the object
6.3)
	A)Insatead of calling to the random method of adjecitves, we instead directly check if the given word is more positive
	or negative, then replace it with the opposite of the result

1.4)
	A)to bombard an enemy companys reviews and discourage customers from going there
2.4)
	A) to infloate your own companys good reviews to look better for customers
3.4)
	A) should make the method acitvely go through and compare each word until it finds a heavily negative word, and automatically
	replaces that with a positive one, (constant comparison type code)
5.4)
	A) removes index 1 one of oneWord
6.4)
	A)because the method has to compare that word to others in a file, none of those words were designed to have a * in front
	So if we kept it, no sentiment value could be assigned to it
7.4)
	A) replace more normal adjecitves with positive ones, maybe subconciosuly benefits the review
