DISCO
* We consulted the ap java subset for reference to inherited methods for Stack interface.
* For the split method, it is backslash '\\' and not forward slash '//'.
* The split method works with ArrayLists.
* Integer.parseInt() is useful when converting int to String. This is especially helpful
  as we are doing operations and overload() requires a return type of String.
* When creating multiple Stacks, we encountered some confusion concerning which Stack we
  would push() and pop() from.

QCC
* Why was division '/' excluded in the list of operations?
* Could we have gone about with the operations without the usage of Integer.parseInt()?
